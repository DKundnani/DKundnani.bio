## Biography

I work at the intersection of biology, statistics, and computation  with a strong application focus on the field of genomics and epigenomics. I work with [Dr. Francesca Storici](http://www.storicilab.gatech.edu/) as a Bioinformatics Ph.D. Graduate Research Assistant in the Storici Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology.  My goal is to delineate presence of ribonucleotides(constructs of RNA) in human genomic DNA finding correlations with other DNA metabolic activities in both in cancer and non-cancer cell types[ [future work ..](https://biosciences.gatech.edu/news/ ]congratulations-francesca-storici-and-natasha-jonoska). 
<br><br>
Before coming to Georgia Tech, I have been fortunate to work with amazing doctors and scientists at Hanash Lab in [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/study-shows-biomarker-panel-boosts-lung-cancer-risk-assessment-for-smokers.h00-159225723.html) and have been a part of incredible effort in diagnostics of [Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Biomarkers](https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/study-shows-biomarker-panel-boosts-lung-cancer-risk-assessment-for-smokers.h00-159225723.html).

IGen is an app to help the consumer be aware of their genetic tendency for susceptibility to multiple infections and be proactive with their health during the time of Global Pandemic. All they need is a DNA test sequencing Results from Companies like 23andMe.[  [Glimpse of the Science behind it](/ppt/IGen.pptx) ]

<br><br>
Discovery of Differntially methylated regions in smokers vs non smokers validated the finding from several other research groups. We were able to see variation in the methylation status based on Race. For prognosis prediction on this [dataset](https://medicine.yale.edu/intmed/vacs/), we used [Veterans Aging Cohort (VACS) Index](https://medicine.yale.edu/intmed/vacs/vacsresources/vacsindexinfo/). Use of support Vector Machines gave the best accuracy. Used of different and more lineant thresholding to extract more features and more information could lead to good AUCs for the methylated regions to be used as Biomarkers or predictors.
