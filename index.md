## Biography

I work at the intersection of <b> biology</b>,<b> statistics</b>, and <b>computation</b>  with a strong application focus on the field of genomics and epigenomics. 
<br>
I work with [Dr. Francesca Storici](http://www.storicilab.gatech.edu/) as a Bioinformatics Ph.D. Graduate Research Assistant in the Storici Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology.  My goal is to delineate presence of ribonucleotides(constructs of RNA) in human genomic DNA finding correlations with other DNA metabolic activities in both in cancer and non-cancer cell types.[[future work ..](https://research.gatech.edu/new-grants-could-transform-scientists-understanding-dna)] 
<br><br>
Before coming to Georgia Tech, I have been fortunate to work with amazing doctors and scientists at Hanash Lab in [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/study-shows-biomarker-panel-boosts-lung-cancer-risk-assessment-for-smokers.h00-159225723.html) and have been a part of incredible effort in diagnostics of [Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Biomarkers](https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/study-shows-biomarker-panel-boosts-lung-cancer-risk-assessment-for-smokers.h00-159225723.html).

IGen is an app to help the consumer be aware of their genetic tendency for susceptibility to multiple infections and be proactive with their health during the time of Global Pandemic. All they need is a DNA test sequencing Results from Companies like 23andMe.[  [Glimpse of the Science behind it](/ppt/IGen.pptx) ]

<br><br>
Discovery of Differntially methylated regions in smokers vs non smokers validated the finding from several other research groups. We were able to see variation in the methylation status based on Race. For prognosis prediction on this [dataset](https://medicine.yale.edu/intmed/vacs/), we used [Veterans Aging Cohort (VACS) Index](https://medicine.yale.edu/intmed/vacs/vacsresources/vacsindexinfo/). Use of support Vector Machines gave the best accuracy. Used of different and more lineant thresholding to extract more features and more information could lead to good AUCs for the methylated regions to be used as Biomarkers or predictors.

## Publications
### [Gene co-expression analysis of human RNASEH2A reveals functional networks associated with DNA replication, DNA damage response, and cell cycle regulation](https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10030221)
<p style="font-size:13px"> Stefania Marsili, Ailone Tichon,<b> Deepali Kundnani </b>, Francesca Storici </p>
<p style="font-size:12px">RNASEH2A is highly expressed in human proliferative tissues and many cancers. Our analyses reveal a possible involvement of RNASEH2A in cell cycle regulation in addition to its well established role in DNA replication and DNA repair. Our findings underscore that RNASEH2A could serve as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and a therapeutic target.</p>

### [Contribution of a Blood-Based Protein Biomarker Panel to the Classification of Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodules](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.09.024)
<p style="font-size:13px"> Edwin J Ostrin, Leonidas E Bantis, David O Wilson, Nikul Patel, Renwei Wang, <b> Deepali Kundnani </b>, Jennifer Adams-Haduch, Jennifer B Dennison, Johannes F Fahrmann, Hsienchang Thomas Chiu, Adi Gazdar, Ziding Feng, Jian-Min Yuan, Samir M Hanash </p>
<p style="font-size:12px">A four-marker biomarker panel, previously validated to improve lung cancer risk prediction, was found to also have utility in distinguishing benign from malignant indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Its performance in improving sensitivity at a high specificity indicates potential utility of the marker panel in assessing likelihood of malignancy in otherwise indeterminate nodules.</p>

### [NFATc Acts as a Non-Canonical Phenotypic Stability Factor for a Hybrid Epithelial/Mesenchymal Phenotype](https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.553342)
<p style="font-size:13px"> Ayalur Raghu Subbalakshmi,<b> Deepali Kundnani </b>, Kuheli Biswas, Anandamohan Ghosh, Samir M Hanash, Satyendra C Tripathi, Mohit Kumar Jolly </p>
<p style="font-size:12px">Reversible transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes – epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its reverse mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) – form a key axis of phenotypic plasticity during metastasis and therapy resistance. Here, employing an integrated computational-experimental approach, we show that the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFATc) can inhibit the process of complete EMT, thus stabilizing the hybrid E/M phenotype. It increases the range of parameters enabling the existence of a hybrid E/M phenotype, thus behaving as a phenotypic stability factor (PSF). Clinical data suggests the effect of NFATc on patient survival in a tissue-specific or context-dependent manner. Together, our results indicate that NFATc behaves as a non-canonical PSF for a hybrid E/M phenotype.</p>

<p style="font-size:12px">Investigation of the repertoire of antigens associated with humoral immune response in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using in-depth proteomic profiling of immunoglobulin-bound proteins from PDAC patient plasmas and identify tumor antigens that induce antibody response together with exosome hallmark proteins. PDAC-derived exosomes are seen to induce a dose-dependent inhibition of PDAC serum-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. </p>


### [Sequential validation of blood-based protein biomarker candidates for early-stage pancreatic cancer](http://example.com/)
<p style="font-size:13px"> Michela Capello, Leonidas E Bantis, Ghislaine Scelo, Yang Zhao, Peng Li, Dilsher S Dhillon, Nikul J Patel, <b> Deepali L Kundnani </b>, Hong Wang, James L Abbruzzese, Anirban Maitra, Margaret A Tempero, Randall Brand, Matthew A Firpo, Sean J Mulvihill, Matthew H Katz, Paul Brennan, Ziding Feng, Ayumu Taguchi, Samir M Hanash </p>
<p style="font-size:12px">Multiple cohort testing and validation yielded a model that consisted of TIMP1, LRG1, and CA19-9 as early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) biomarkers. The model yielded areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.949 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.917 to 0.981) and 0.887 (95% CI = 0.817 to 0.957) with sensitivities of 0.849 and 0.667 at 95% specificity in discriminating early-stage PDAC vs healthy subjects in the combined validation and test sets, respectively. The performance of the biomarker panel was statistically significantly improved compared with CA19-9 alone (P < .001, combined validation set; P = .008, test set).The addition of TIMP1 and LRG1 immunoassays to CA19-9 statistically significantly improves the detection of early-stage PDAC.</p>
