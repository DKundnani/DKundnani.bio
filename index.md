## Biography

I work at the intersection of biology, statistics, and computation  with a strong application focus on the field of genomics and epigenomics. I work with [Dr. Francesca Storici](http://www.storicilab.gatech.edu/) as a Bioinformatics Ph.D. Graduate Research Assistant in the Storici Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology.  My goal is to delineate presence of ribonucleotides(constructs of RNA) in human genomic DNA finding correlations with other DNA metabolic activities in both in cancer and non-cancer cell types. 
<br><br>
Through my work in The Storici Lab, I have recently co-authored a [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/10/3/221) and received US National Science Foundation Conference Award for a poster presentation in RNA Society 2021
<br><br>
Before coming to Georgia Tech, I have been fortunate to work with amazing doctors and scientists at Hanash Lab in [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/study-shows-biomarker-panel-boosts-lung-cancer-risk-assessment-for-smokers.h00-159225723.html) and have been a part of incredible effort in diagnostics of [Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Biomarkers](https://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/study-shows-biomarker-panel-boosts-lung-cancer-risk-assessment-for-smokers.h00-159225723.html).
